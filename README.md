# advent-of-code-2017
In which I attempt to do the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) challenges in a few different languages.

Starting out with Ruby, Go, bash, and C# (using .csx so I don't have to set up a whole .NET project). I might switch to a language I'm more familiar with (Python or JavaScript) as the problems get harder.
